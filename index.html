        <h3>Our identity</h3>
        <p>In the general economy, businesses and individuals exchange resources, in order to survive. Unfortunately, every business has its own segmentation, meaning that there is an uncertainty of unmet needs.</p>
        <p>Governmental institutions play an important role in meeting public needs, as they have relatively more resources than businesses. Unfortunately, they only have few years of term limits to actualize programs.</p>
        <p>Educational institutions produce the next practitioners and academicians, which will solve the social problems. Unfortunately, their schedules are tight with deadlines and their collaborations are bounded with faculties.</p>
        <p>Aktivis FOSS is born to fill the three parties' limitations. We build a network where everyone can flexibly solve real problems in Indonesia, especially for public and education sector.</p>
